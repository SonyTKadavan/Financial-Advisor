# Agents Lab Notebook v1.0.0

This project demonstrates how to use agents configured in **IBM watsonx.ai Agent Lab**. The notebook walks through the process of creating and running a LangGraph agent that leverages IBM's foundation models and tools for prompt-based AI tasks.

## üîç Overview

The notebook includes:

- Setup and authentication with IBM Watsonx.ai
- Use of `langchain_ibm` and `ibm_watsonx_ai` libraries
- Building a React-style agent using `langgraph`
- Integration with LangChain's memory-saving and toolkits
- Execution of a reasoning-based task via an AI agent

## üß∞ Dependencies

Make sure the following Python packages are installed:

```bash
pip install langchain_ibm ibm-watsonx-ai langgraph
